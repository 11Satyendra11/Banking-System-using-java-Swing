###### ABSTRACT

The adoption of Electronic Banking by commercial enterprises has been in existence since
the mid 90’s, much greater in number due to lower operating costs associated with it.
Electronic banking has initially been in the form of automatic teller machines and
telephone transactions. More recently a new delivery channel for banking services that
benefits both customers and banks is in implementation i.e. using computers.

In this proposed interface, manager and accountant have access to the customer’s
account, and manager have special preference to access all details of banking system.

Banking system services can include:

► Client

► Front Office Advisors

► Managers


#### INTRODUCTION

A Bank is a commercial or state institution that provides financial services,
including issuing money in form of coins, bank notes or debit cards,

receiving deposits of money, lending money and processing transections. A
commercial bank accepts deposits from customers and in turn makes loan
based on those deposits.

This project is basically providing a full service user friendly interface primarily
specializing in Banking Management System;

We are using following details of clients:

```
l Client ID
l First Name
l Last Name
l Photo
l Date Of Birth
l Account Type
l Gender
l Telephone
l Address

l View the balance and transaction history of their accounts
l Extract statements of account(s) in .csv format
```
```
l Make a Transfer(Internal or external)
l Feed and account

```
The bank will provide following functionalities to managers:
```
```

```
* We will provide an email alert to the customer after the account creation
providing them with their account numbers.

* We will also provide email alert for each deposit and withdrawal of money
from his/her account.

**PROBLEM DEFINITION AND PROPOSAL**

INTRODUCTION

In proposed system, the management needs not to keep any type of
registers, which they use to keep in old one. They have work only with one
computer. All the details are stored in computer files. The dual entries are done
very quickly as entry in one file only , affects the other file where it has to record.
In the way there is no need to record the computer operator.

The working through registers system is not only very laborious and
time consuming , but there are number of errors found. In comparison to old
system the proposed system of computer processes many advantages.

```
Some of the merits of proposed system are as follows:-
```
```
l Accuracy:-
```
It is one of the features of computer that it provides accuracy result. It is often said,
“Man does mistakes but machines never”. When a man works there seems
numbers of errors and mistakes in performing calculation and other things, while it
is not in case with computers.

```
l Security:-
```
```
The security is maintained vary comfortably in computers. Secretes are
not disclosed off, as there are password settings in the computers. So
the firm can get the benefit of non-disclosure of its secrets to the
outsider competitors as well as other non-authorized persons.
```

l **Time saving:-**
The computerized system is time saving. On an immediate inquiry , the operator
or any authorized person has to just click some switches and get the information in
few seconds.

```
l Perform Repetitive Task Very Well:-
```
It is said that computer never tires. I do the repetitive task very well as it never
feels laziness. Performance of repetitive task by a man is not well Performed, as
main tires very quickly and feels lazy. It is not in the case with computer. So,
proposed system is beneficial than Old one.

**EXISTING SYSTEM**

Presently there is no such system available. Some are there with
limited access and following limitations:

```
l Time consuming...
```
```
l More expensive...
```
```
l Searching problem...
```
```
l Maintains problem of all registers...
```
```
l Less accuracy...
```
```
l Problem for marking of not normal value...
```

**PROPOSED SYSTEM**

In our system we are looking forward to provide following
advantages to users:

##### lTime saving...

##### lLess expensive...

##### lPowerful searching...

##### lSolve the problem of maintains register...

##### lMore accuracy...

##### lEasy generate report...

##### lNot display multiple reports...
